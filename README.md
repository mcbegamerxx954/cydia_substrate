# This crate is not tested to even work yet
I sadly cant test this crate nor its ffi bindings because i dont have a iphone,
much less a jailbroken one to test it on.

# Cydia Substrate
This is a more ergonomic but still pretty thin wrapper around
substrate-sys which aims to make calling substrate from rust
not as much of a hassle as using the raw ffi bindings
